This assignment will showcase our undestanding creating subparts in Hierarchy, local and global translation and rotation, and position-quaternion for orbital camera

 Keyboard inputs for camera, plane (turtle), and subparts (wings and cannon):
  Camera:
		Select camera to control: b
		Select camera to view: v

  plane2 (turtle2):
		s	= moves the plane2 forward
		f	= moves the plane2 backward
		e	= rolls the plane2 (+Z rot)
		q	= rolls the plane2 (-Z rot)
		x	= pitches the plane2 (+X rot)
		w	= pitches the plane2 (-X rot)
		a	= yaws the plane2 (+Y rot)
		d	= yaws the plane2 (-Y rot)

		r	= rotates right wings anticlockwise (subpart)
		R	= rotates right wings clockwise (subpart)
		t	= rotates left wings anticlockwise (subpart)
		T	= rotates left wings clockwise (subpart)
		y	= rotates cannon base to the right (subpart)
		Y	= rotates cannon base to the left (subpart)
		u	= rotates cannon to the right (subsubpart)
		U	= rotates cannon to the left (subsubpart)

	 plane1 (turtle1):
		S	= moves the plane1 forward
		F	= moves the plane1 backward
		E	= rolls the plane1 (+Z rot)
		Q	= rolls the plane1 (-Z rot)
		X	= pitches the plane1 (+X rot)
		W	= pitches the plane1 (-X rot)
		A	= yaws the plane1 (+Y rot)
		D	= yaws the plane1 (-Y rot)

Mouse inputs for world-relative camera:
Hold left button and drag  = controls azimuth and elevation
(Press CTRL (and hold) before left button to restrict to azimuth control only, Press SHIFT (and hold) before left button to restrict to elevation control only)
Hold right button and drag = controls distance

Restart the application to restore the models and the cameras to their starting position
